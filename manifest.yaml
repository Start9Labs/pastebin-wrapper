  short: "Simple, fast, standalone pastebin service."
  long: |
    Whenever you need to share a code snippet, diff, logs, or a secret with another human being, the Pastebin service is invaluable. However, using public services such as pastebin.com, privnote.com, etc. should be avoided when you're sharing data that should be available only for a selected audience (i.e., your company, private network). Instead of trusting external providers, you could host your own Pastebin service and take ownership of all your data!
